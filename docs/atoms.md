# Atoms

Atoms are basic tags, such as form labels, inputs or buttons. They also include more abstract elements like color palettes, fonts, and animations.

Atoms are abstract and aren't often terribly useful on their own, but they provide a useful reference and allow you to see all your global styles laid out at a glance.
